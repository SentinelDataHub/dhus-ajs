				1. Introduction
	The Copernicus program is a cooperation of the European Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) for Earth observation. ESA coordinates the acquisition and delivery of Earth observation data from space. Starting with the successful launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, the series of Sentinel satellites will deliver a wide range of data for environmental and civil security purposes.
	Under the ESA – European Community GMES Agreement of 28 February 2008, as amended subsequently, the agency is charged with managing the GMES Space Component (GSC) Programme. A new agreement to be concluded between ESA and the European Union (EU), consistent with the EU Copernicus Regulation, will provide the legal framework for the continuation of ESA’s activities related to the Copernicus Space Component.

	7. Availability of the Service
	ESA will make best efforts to provide the Sentinel data access service through the Sentinel data Hub. It is understood and recognised by all individuals and entities having accepted these Data Supply Conditions, that ESA is not in a position to guarantee the availability of Sentinel data through the Sentinel Data Hub.
	In particular, ESA reserves the right to review, modify, suspend or terminate the provision of Sentinel data through the Sentinel Data Hub at any time in the event:
	of technical capacity constraints due to the number of user requests
	of lack of sufficient funding for sustaining Sentinel missions, and associated facilities and activities,
	that satellite or ground system failure occurs,
	that planned activities of related Sentinel systems and facilities are suspended or cancelled in order for ESA to carry out activities considered of a higher priority.
	The operating entity, i.e. ESA, may modify the Sentinels’ operations plans at any time, should it consider such corrective action necessary for ensuring the missions safety and success.
